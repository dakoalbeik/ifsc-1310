  <section><article class="container"><h2 class="article">Progressive Enhancement</h2><p>Progressive enhancement is a web design strategy that focuses on prioritizing the delivery 
  of content and functionality to the user over presentation.
  This is done by separating the presentation from the content itself. Presentation is provided 
  in options depending on the browser used. This is important because it allows everyone to access the content at
  minimum while still allowing users with advanced browsers and/or fast internet connection to access other
  presentational features that older browsers may not support.
  This is contrary to graceful degradation which focused on developing websites for newer browsers and adding functionality
  that deprives users with old browsers from accessing the content efficiently.</p></article>
  <article class="container"><h2 class="article">Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2><p>At the beginning of this semester I thought that I would struggle a lot more than I ended up doing. As soon as we got into writing CSS,
  I became much more intrigued. The idea of writing structure, design, then functionality in separate stages really fascinated me. It showed me how broad this field actually is.
  I'm thankful that I got to learn a lot more than I thought I would. It's unbelievable that I got to create my own website this semester.
  This is something I've always wanted to do for my photography business and now I can do that in theory. I'm incredibly grateful for all the help and the resources that 
  were provided for us this semester. The class being online made no difference. I found the sessions and content to be very engaging. One thing that I did well this semester is go over 
  all the materials that were provided for me. By doing so I allowed myself to understand the overall idea and fill in any missing gaps. What was fascinating to me is that many things 
  that were taught to us on day one never actually clicked until the last day. It seems like everything linked together. If I could go back and do one thing differently I would give 
  HTML more attention. I still feel that I struggle with structuring elements according to their hierarchical value.

As far as the feedback that was given to me on my website, I shared this website with several of my friends and family members. 
I got good feedback overall and some criticism. Some mentioned that the website is too wordy, especially the parts where the sentences 
go all the way from the left to the right. So I went ahead and limited the width of the body . It was suggested to me to play
with different fonts and colors. I was told that the website looked more like a Word document than a Segway website. So I 
went ahead and used more vibrant colors and made the header picture shorter as the height of it was taking too much real estate on 
the web page. Some criticism was hard to fix due to my limited JavaScript knowledge. It would have been quite nice to include 
more bells and whistles but for one semester I'm happy with the outcome.
